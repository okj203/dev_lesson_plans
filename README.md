## File  structure 
```html
sprint_1
    |
    |- demos
    |    |- demo_1
    |    |- demo_2
    |    |- demo_3
    |- lecture_notes
        |- assets
        |- readme.md
        |- slides.md
```
+ `sprint_1` can be used for a single lecture or it can be broken down into 2 or more lectures, depending on individual cohort's schedule.
+ In the `lecture_notes`, `slides.md` is used to present overall info that students need to understand to comprehend the demo. At <program_name> students are expected to pace themselves as they work on projects on <program_name>. Not all students are expected to show up, having all the tasks on <program_name> completed. `slides.md` is designed to help students review the learning material at a high level in an organized manner. By presenting or quickly going over `slides.md`, instructors can ensure that at least all the students are informed of major concepts that will be adopted during a demo before taking a deep dive into the demo.
+ `readme.md` is designed to help instructor with their presentation of `slides.md`, and **is NOT meant to be shared with students.**
+ `assets` stores images that are used in `slides.md` and `readme.md`.
+ Instructor may use a demo of their choice from the `demos` folder either after the initial presentation is over or whenever `slides.md` calls for a demo.
