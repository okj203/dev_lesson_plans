## 1. Display Property

* "Every element on a web page is a rectangular box. The display property in CSS determines just how that rectangular box behaves."
[CSS Tricks - Display](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/d/display/)

---

## 2. Common Values for Display Property

* `inline` - Displays an element as an inline element (like <span>). Any height and width properties will have no effect
* `block` - Displays an element as a block element (like <p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width
* `none` - The element is completely removed
* `flex` - Displays an element as a block-level flex container
* `grid` - Displays an element as a block-level grid container

## 4. Flexbox Basics

* `flex` is one of the most commonly used values for the display property
* Flexbox allows us to distribute HTML elements evenly and dynamically
* "The Flexbox Layout aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word 'flex')."

## 5. Common Flexbox Properties

```css
.container {
    display: flex; 
    /* defines a flex container */
    flex-direction: row(default) | column; 
    /* defines the direction flex items are placed in the flex container */
    justify-content: flex-start(default) | space-evenly;
    /* horizontally distributes items; 
    space-evenly - items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal. */
    align-items: stretch(default) | center;
    /* vertically aligns/distributes items; 
    center - items are centered in the cross-axis baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align */
}

```
