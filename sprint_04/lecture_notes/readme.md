## 1. Grid Basics

* The CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns. It is useful in creating more complex and organized layouts.

* To define a grid container, you will have to pass a display: grid property to your element.

* [CSS Grid Vs. Flexbox](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/css-tutorial/css-grid-vs-flexbox#:~:text=Flexbox%20is%20made%20for%20one,Grids%20can%20work%20on%20both.)

## 2. Flex VS. Grid

* Flexbox is made for one-dimensional layouts vs. grid is made for two-dimensional layouts.
* Flexbox can work on either rows or columns at a time vs. grid can work on both.

<!-- To create a grid-like layout by only using flex, you'd have to create multiple flex containers nested under another flex container. Using grid you only need to create 1 container, which makes it suitable for a more complex layout. -->

## 3. Common Grid Properties

* `grid-template-columns` specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout.
* `grid-template-rows` specifies the number (and the heights) of the rows in a grid layout.
* `grid-auto-rows` sets a size for the rows in a grid container.
* `grid-column-gap` defines the size of the gap between the columns in a grid layout.
* `grid-row-gap` defines the size of the gap between the rows in a grid layout.

* `grid-gap` defines the size of the gap between the rows and columns in a grid layout
* `grid-template-areas` specifies areas within the grid layout.
* `grid-area` specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout
* `grid-column-start` defines on which column-line the item will start.
* `grid-column-end` defines how many columns an item will span, or on which column-line the item will end
