# Housekeeping Rules
* I'd like to talk about a few housekeeping rules for everyone to have the best Mimo experience.

---

## Online Lecture Etiquette

* Keep the chat focused on the material, that means no side conversations in the zoom chat

* Keep your microphone muted at all times, unless you're asked to speak. This is to make sure that we don't interrupt each other.

* Also, I highly encourage you to keep the camera on for the best experience - It's not mandatory but I want to see your faces and know if you're engaged or confused or if I completely lost you. 

Let's say I'm talking to you with my camera on but if your camera is off while you're talking to me, I'm just talking to a dark screen, which is not very professional. Although Mimo does provide a flexible learning environment, when you attend a lecture, collaborate with your cohort mates, or have one on ones with me, those are professional moments. I need you to stay professional and disciplined. 

With that being said, if you have any feedback for me, please let me know so that I can be a better instructor and better support for all of you.

* Last but not least, there will be allocated question time, please avoid randomly jumping in while I'm presenting during the lecture. If you have anything you'd like to say or ask, the zoom handraise button is your best friend!

While we're on the topic of the questions:

## A Quick word about Questions

0. If and when you have questions, please use the handraise button. This allows me to address your questions in the order the questions are asked, and we don't need to play the awkward guessing game of whose turn it is to ask or speak.

Does everyone know where the handraise button is?

Before raising a question during the class please ask yourself:

1. How relevant is it to everyone?
2. Will the answer help today?
3. How much time / space am I taking?
4. Am I just showing off?

We all have limited time. As much as I highly encourage you to ask questions, when you do ask questions, please be mindful and respectful toward everyone else's limited time by making sure that your questions are short, clear, and relevant to the topic. If I need you to further clarify your questions, I will ask you to do so. So please make it concise. 

If you have questions that are not directly related to the topic of the lecture but you would still like to talk about, we can talk about it during our one-on-ones, office hours, you can also message me. You'll definitely have plenty of opportunities to address any issues or questions. So during the live sessions, please stay within the scope of the topic.

---

## Participate!

* Volunteer to answer questions posed by me by using the handraise button or by sharing your reponses in the chat. For simple yes or no questions, in the chat, you can simply drop a v for a yes and x for a no.

<!-- mimo zoom does not have this feature: 
you can also drop the red `x` button for a `no` and the green `v` button for a `yes`. 
Does everyone see the red x and green v buttons?  -->
Can everyone please give me a NO? 
Now give me a YES.

The more you participate, the more you get out of this experience. Everybody spends the same time, same money, and get the same resources. But how you utilize those resources and whether or not you make the most of it is up to you and your participation. I really want all my students to take advantage of the opportunity to make most of it. 

* Don't be afraid of giving the wrong answers. Whether you give a right answer or wrong answer, it all helps you improve your technical communication skills. Quick question - when do you need your technical communication skills the most? 

Please drop your answers in the chat.
-> JOB INTERVIEWS, PRESENTATION, GROUP WORK, etc.

## Cohort Culture 
* Be kind to each other
* This is NOT a competition

Your cohortmates and Mimo staff members are one of your very first tech networks. They are and they should be the most generous audience that you'll interact with. They understand exactly what you're going through and your struggles. This is a safe learning environment and I hope you all can respect that. Always remember that people that you interact with at Mimo are your potential professional references and future coworkers. So please be kind to each other. If anyone, whether that's a classmate or literally anyone at Mimo makes you feel uncomfortable or treat you unprofessionally or unkindly, please let me know and I will handle the situation. 

* **RESPOND TO INSTRUCTORS' SLACK MESSAGES**

Since this is a remote learning program, if you don't repond to my slack messages, it becomes hard for me to help you and keep track of your learning progress. 

For example, I posted a message last week asking you to confirm whether the survey link works by reacting to the message with your favorite emoji, but I believe only two people did it. I'm not sure if you're in a wrong channel or if you can't see my messages for some reason, but if you can, please respond asap. If you have trouble with using slack just shoot me an email real quick, but if you have no technical issues whatsoever but simply choose not to respond to my messages, then we have a bigger problem. Just bear in mind that keeping an open communication with me will help you in the long-run, since I'm obviously here to help you but I won't know how to help you if you become unresponsive. A lot of my past students have become software engineers in some of the top companies, so I know exactly what it takes to turn a non-tech person into a software engineer. So please take advantage of the time we have together.  

Also remember that most of the important cohort related information will be communicated through slack, so, I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH, please stay on top of your slack communication.

## Attendance 

Attending live lectures is not mandatory but I will take attendance. I'll take a screenshot of the zoom participant tab in the beginning of the lecture and it'll literally take half second. Missing attendance will not be used against you in any way, but this is just so I have a better understanding of the level of engagement. 

Also I’ve been asked by a lot my former students to be their professional reference towards the end of their job interview process, and keeping a record of my students’ performance and engagement gives me a better idea of how I can promote my student to the company. 

<!-- In case any one asks, many of my students got hired by:
bloomberg, dropbox, persado, investment banks, startups, some of the major coding bootcamps as engineers and technical instructors. 

Of course there are ones who got into faang companies but that doesn't happen very often when you're fresh out of bootcamps.

## To-Do List

1. [Bi-weekly 1-on-1s](https://calendly.com/cathy-267/30min-1?month=2022-09&date=2022-09-21): link available on our slack channel `cohort_20`

    - Please schedule 1-on-1s with me every 2 weeks to discuss your progress and plans.

2. [Survey Due: Tuesday 9:00PM EST](https://forms.gle/WCYnvGcQG8cSeqjC7)

    - I'm also going to drop both links in the zoom chat, so in case you weren't able to complete the survey last week because of slack issues, now there really should be no reason why I won't see all your responses by tomorrow.

    - Please fill out the form to let me know when you're available for a live lecture on weekly basis. If you don't submit your response by Tuesday 9pm Eastern Standard Time, I will pick a time that works for everyone who did fill out the form, and announce our schedule on Wednesday. 

    - For this reason, our first lecture will happen on either Thursday or Friday just this week, and when the permanant schedule is decided I will announce it in the slack channel and I'll also update our cohort google calendar.
